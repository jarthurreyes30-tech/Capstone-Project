# Registration System - Fixed!

## ✅ ALL REGISTRATION ISSUES RESOLVED

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Donor Registration
**Problem:** After registration, showed "Page not found" error

**Fix:**
- Changed redirect from `/auth/verify` to `/auth/login`
- After successful registration, donor is redirected to login page
- Can immediately login with new credentials

**File:** `RegisterDonor.tsx`
```typescript
// Before:
navigate(`/auth/verify?email=${encodeURIComponent(formData.email)}`);

// After:
navigate('/auth/login');
```

---

### 2. ✅ Charity Registration - Submit Button
**Problem:** Submit button didn't work, form didn't submit

**Fix:**
- Properly prepare FormData with all fields
- Add all document files to FormData
- Send complete data to backend API
- Redirect to login after successful submission
- Clear draft from localStorage after submission

**File:** `RegisterCharity.tsx`
```typescript
// Now properly creates FormData with:
- All form fields
- All uploaded documents
- Document types
- Proper file handling
```

---

### 3. ✅ Charity Registration - Save Draft Button
**Problem:** Save draft button didn't work

**Fix:**
- Save draft to localStorage
- Store both formData and documents
- Show success toast
- Can be loaded later

**File:** `RegisterCharity.tsx`
```typescript
localStorage.setItem('charity_draft', JSON.stringify({ formData, documents }));
```

---

### 4. ✅ Auth Service - Charity Registration
**Problem:** Service didn't handle FormData properly

**Fix:**
- Accept FormData directly
- Properly map form fields to backend expected format
- Handle file uploads correctly

**File:** `auth.ts`
```typescript
// Now handles:
- FormData input
- All organization fields
- All representative fields
- Document uploads
```
