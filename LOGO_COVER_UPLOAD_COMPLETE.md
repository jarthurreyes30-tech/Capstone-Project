## 🗄️ Backend Implementation

### Database Migration
**File:** `2025_10_02_add_cover_image_to_charities_table.php`

```php
Schema::table('charities', function (Blueprint $table) {
    $table->string('cover_image')->nullable()->after('logo_path');
});
```

**Existing Column:**
- `logo_path` (already exists)

**New Column:**
- `cover_image` (added)

### Charity Model Updated
**File:** `Charity.php`

```php
protected $fillable = [
    'owner_id','name','reg_no','tax_id','mission','vision','website',
    'contact_email','contact_phone','logo_path','cover_image',  // ✅ Added cover_image
    'verification_status','verified_at','verification_notes'
];
```

### AuthController Updated
**File:** `AuthController.php`

```php
// Handle logo upload
$logoPath = null;
if ($r->hasFile('logo')) {
    $logoPath = $r->file('logo')->store('charity_logos', 'public');
}

// Handle cover image upload
$coverPath = null;
if ($r->hasFile('cover_image')) {
    $coverPath = $r->file('cover_image')->store('charity_covers', 'public');
}

// Save to charity record
$charity = $user->charities()->create([
    // ... other fields
    'logo_path' => $logoPath,
    'cover_image' => $coverPath,
    // ...
]);
```

   - Saves paths to database
   - Creates charity record

4. **Admin Review**
