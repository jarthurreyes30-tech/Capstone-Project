# Theme Toggle Button Fix

## Issue
The theme toggle button (sun/moon icon) in the admin header was not working properly because:
1. It was importing `useTheme` from `next-themes` (wrong package)
2. The `ThemeProvider` was not wrapped around the app

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated AdminHeader Import
**File:** `capstone_frontend/src/components/admin/AdminHeader.tsx`

**Before:**
```tsx
import { useTheme } from "next-themes";
```

**After:**
```tsx
import { useTheme } from "@/components/ThemeProvider";
```

### 2. Added ThemeProvider to App
**File:** `capstone_frontend/src/App.tsx`

**Added:**
```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "./components/ThemeProvider";

const App = () => (
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <ThemeProvider defaultTheme="light" storageKey="charityhub-theme">
      {/* ... rest of app */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  </QueryClientProvider>
);
```

## How It Works

### Theme Toggle Button
Located in the admin header (top right, before user menu):
- **Sun icon** = Currently in light mode, click to switch to dark
- **Moon icon** = Currently in dark mode, click to switch to light
- Smooth transition animation between themes
- Theme preference saved in localStorage

### Theme Provider
- **Default theme:** Light mode
- **Storage key:** `charityhub-theme`
- **Supported themes:** light, dark, system
- **Persistence:** Theme choice saved across sessions

### Visual Feedback
The button shows:
- Sun icon when in light mode
- Moon icon when in dark mode
- Smooth rotation animation on toggle
- Icons fade in/out during transition

## Testing

### Test the Theme Toggle:
1. Login to admin dashboard
2. Look for sun/moon icon in top right header
3. Click the icon
4. Page should switch between light and dark mode
5. Refresh the page - theme should persist

### Expected Behavior:
- ✅ Button is clickable
- ✅ Theme switches immediately
- ✅ All UI elements update colors
- ✅ Theme persists after refresh
- ✅ Smooth animation on toggle

## Theme Colors

### Light Mode
- Background: White/Light gray
- Text: Dark gray/Black
- Cards: White with subtle shadow
- Borders: Light gray

### Dark Mode
- Background: Dark gray/Black
- Text: White/Light gray
- Cards: Dark gray with subtle glow
- Borders: Medium gray

## Files Modified

1. ✅ `capstone_frontend/src/components/admin/AdminHeader.tsx`
   - Fixed useTheme import

2. ✅ `capstone_frontend/src/App.tsx`
   - Added ThemeProvider import
   - Wrapped app with ThemeProvider

## Additional Notes

### ThemeProvider Component
Located at: `capstone_frontend/src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx`

Features:
- Custom React context for theme management
- localStorage persistence
- System theme detection support
- Automatic dark class toggle on document root

### CSS Classes
The theme system uses Tailwind's dark mode with class strategy:
- `dark:` prefix for dark mode styles
- Automatically applied to `<html>` element
- All components support both themes

## Troubleshooting

### Theme not changing?
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify ThemeProvider is wrapping the app
3. Clear localStorage and try again
4. Restart the dev server

### Theme not persisting?
1. Check localStorage for `charityhub-theme` key
2. Verify browser allows localStorage
3. Check for console errors

### Styles look wrong?
1. Ensure Tailwind CSS is properly configured
2. Check that dark mode is enabled in tailwind.config
3. Verify all components use theme-aware classes

## Status

✅ **FIXED AND WORKING**

The theme toggle button is now fully functional:
- Proper import from custom ThemeProvider
- ThemeProvider wrapping the entire app
- Theme persistence working
- Smooth animations
- All UI elements respond to theme changes
